# To-Do List App in Swift

A simple To-Do List application built in Swift that allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks. This is a command-line version of a task manager that can be extended with a user interface or other features in the future.

## Features
- **Add tasks**: You can add new tasks to the list.
- **Toggle completion**: You can mark tasks as completed or pending.
- **Remove tasks**: You can remove tasks from the list.

## How It Works
This app uses the following components:
- **Task Class**: Represents a single task with a name and a completion status.
- **TaskManager Class**: Manages the list of tasks. It supports adding tasks, toggling completion status, and removing tasks.

### Example of Usage
```swift
// Create a task manager instance
let taskManager = TaskManager()

// Add some tasks
taskManager.addTask(name: "Buy groceries")
taskManager.addTask(name: "Walk the dog")
taskManager.addTask(name: "Finish Swift project")

// Toggle the completion status of a task
taskManager.toggleTaskCompletion(at: 0)

// Print tasks
taskManager.printTasks()

// Remove a task
taskManager.removeTask(at: 1)

// Print tasks after removal
taskManager.printTasks()
